          <h2>Our History and Heritage</h2><br />
          <p>RunFlat International was established in 2001 as a subsidiary of its parent company Westley Plastics using its leading edge polymer technology to exclusively develop run-flat tyre insert systems.</p><br />
          <p>RunFlat International originates from Westley Group, a European leading non-ferrous foundry and engineering group since the beginning of the 19th century in the cradle of the industrial revolution.</p><br />
          <p>Westley Plastics was started in the 1960â€™s, developing polymer technologies to replace heavier, more expensive and less wear-resistant metal products.</p><br />
          <p>RunFlat International is a subsidiary and partner of Westley Plastics which specialises exclusively in run-flat systems. Our composite material has been developed and is processed specifically for run-flat applications while our products are subject to multiple patents.</p><br />
          <p>Recently Wheels International was established to work in parallel with RunFlat International and specialise in lightweight, high load military/security alloy and steel wheels manufactured in Europe.</p><br />
